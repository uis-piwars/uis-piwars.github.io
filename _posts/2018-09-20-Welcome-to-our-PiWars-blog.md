We've entered PiWars 2019. But what does that mean, who are we, and why should you care?

My name is Rob and I work for [University Information Services](http://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). Together with my colleages Anna and Sam we have entered a robotics competition called [PiWars[(https://piwars.org/) which will take place in March 2019. Participants use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to make a roving robot to solve challenges.

Anna is a fairly new member of the UIS, and she was the one who first told me about the competition. She's attended the PiWars event in previous years, but I'm totally new to it. I thought it would be a fun challenge that's a bit different to what I do for my job, but not so much that I'd be a total fish out of water. I love Raspberry Pis and have spent many happy hours tinkering with them by myself, and I like the idea of working with others with the same interest. I also thought it could be a good way of meeting people at work who I otherwise don't get to work with very closely. And I always wanted to build a mobile autonomous robot.

Sam joined us soon after we submitted our application. For my job I have to deploy a lot of applications on servers, and Sam is the one who makes sure I have the servers I need. He's also got quite a bit of experience with electronics and robotics, and has built a little rover himself in the past (one of those "smart car" kit type thingies).

 (Julie Andrews)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews] charmed us as the title character of the 1964 film (Mary Poppins)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)] when she sang ("A Spoonful of Sugar")[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Spoonful_of_Sugar]:

I always wanted to learn more about physical computing. To do something practical with the pile of Raspberry Pis I've acquired over the years, more than just plugging in pre-made HATs. But I've never quite been able to make the time. And that usually means I haven't had the motivation.

PiWars changes that, because it introduces the element of fun. I'm not just putting together stuff for my own interest, I have a goal in sight: competing in a competition with my friends. And crucially, I also have a deadline!

I'm looking forward to working on our robot, learning new things, and maybe even making something that can give other competitors a run for their money. Let the PiWars begin!
