We've entered PiWars 2019. But what does that mean, who are we, and why should you care?

My name is Rob and I work as a network specialist for [University Information Services](http://www.uis.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). Together with my colleages Anna and Sam we have entered a robotics competition called [PiWars](https://piwars.org/) which will take place in March 2019. Participants use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to make a roving robot to solve challenges.

Anna is a fairly new member of the UIS, and she was the one who first told me about the competition. She's a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) specialist, and  works next door to me, in the same room as Sam. She's been to a few PiWars events in the past, so she's our resident PiWars expert.

Sam joined us soon after we submitted our application. For my job I have to deploy a lot of applications on servers, and Sam is the [sysadmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) who makes sure I have the servers I need. He's also got quite a bit of experience with electronics and robotics, and has built a little rover himself in the past (one of those "smart car" kit type thingies).

While Anna has attended PiWars in the past, Sam and I are totally new to it. I thought it would be a fun challenge that's a bit different to what I do for my job, but not so much that I'd be a total fish out of water. I love Raspberry Pis and have spent many happy hours tinkering with them by myself, and I like the idea of working with others with the same interest. I also thought it could be a good way of meeting people at work who I otherwise don't get to work with very closely.

And I always wanted to build a mobile autonomous robot.

[Julie Andrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews) charmed us as the title character of the 1964 film [Mary Poppins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)) when she sang ["A Spoonful of Sugar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Spoonful_of_Sugar]):
 
> In every job that must be done  
> There is an element of fun  
> You find the fun and snap!  
> The job's a game  
> And every task you undertake  
> Becomes a piece of cake  
> A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see...  

I always wanted to learn more about physical computing. To do something practical with the pile of Raspberry Pis I've acquired over the years, more than just plugging in pre-made [HATs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-raspberry-pi-hats/). But I've never quite been able to make the time. And that usually means I haven't had the motivation.

PiWars changes that, because it introduces the element of fun. I'm not just putting together stuff for my own interest, I have a goal in sight: competing in a competition with my friends. And crucially, I also have a deadline!

I'm looking forward to working on our robot, learning new things, and maybe even making something that can give other competitors a run for their money.

Let the PiWars begin!
